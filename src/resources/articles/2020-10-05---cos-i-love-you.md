AG Cooks sonic identity was born in a cultural moment that the world might still be trying to comprehend. The year is 2012, the term “viral,” is becoming common language, a decade of R&B artists like Usher dominating the pop charts gets displaced by a young Justin Beiber who breaks into pop charts only to have Rebbeca Black’s “Friday” be the laughable earworm stuck in people's heads. At the same time, metamodernism's combination of searing irony and genuine sincerity is finding its roots in videos of Shia LeBeouf screaming  “don’t let your dreams be dreams!,” and Nike’s tagline “Do it! Just Do It,” till he gets red in the face.

The internet is starting to express its potential as a cultural change and propagation agent. Cook is absorbing all this and several other influences like K-pop, Nightcore, Jumpstyle, and Frank Zappa’s Synclavier music to eventually produce an infectious kind of thoroughly-detailed, over-produced “saturated” electronic pop music that bursts with personality and glamorizes consumption in a way that makes you feel like your glucose levels are off the charts. Cook’s “Money On a Gold Plate / Cos I Love You,” EP is a good example of high-fructose production. It is hyper-pop.

The track “Cos I Love You, ” can be described as a whirlwind series of grimy and acidic synth stabs and alarms that provide the counterpoint to a consistent pitched percussion line that sounds like a detuned xylophone. Filtered out kicks are alternated with heavily overdriven ones and rapidly timed snare rolls are made to rattle the bones. All this happens while PC music’s GFOTY sings lyrics in a cutesy voice that contrasts the aggressively percussive feeling and 140 bpm tempo of the music. Altogether the music and lyrics deliver an intense celebration of the Anthropocene. 

Lyrical lines like “I don’t want to be real,”; “take a little bit and make it,”; “cause I love,” capture a sensation that might be described as what happens to people when you add fast-paced communication technology to fast-paced market-driven Spectacular societies. We stop caring about what’s real and begin to accept the consumer-facing version of clean cityscape, ordered social life, and easily navigable cyberspace that banking networks and their social media cohorts present as the true face of the internet, and we get sick.

Cook’s music takes that feeling of sickness to its overwhelming conclusion. Helping us realize as consumers that somewhere along the line either the politicians or the bankers have pulled the wool over our eyes, convinced us that economies and neural networks are the best way to manage populations, and that buying into participation in social media and branded content as the be and end-all of human life. They have simplified our collective understanding of what's real and possible by substituting truth for convenience. Eliminated agency and the guidance of family and community to have it replaced with the Facebook ad as the navigational compass through oceans of artificial human life. 

Cook’s Hyperpop is both alluring and off-putting because it threatens to bring its listeners to the realization that what they thought of as their personhood and personality was just an elaborately manufactured lie baked into them by facebook's habit-forming design techniques - mindless hours scrolling through timelines that depict insular communities, fake friends, improvising politicians and a continuing willful ignorance of the existential threat of global warming. 

We build ourselves as pleasant faces and internalize our existential dread so that we may be loved. We listen to absurdly intense electronic music in the hope that it relieves us of our dread and does the same to our friends. Allowing us to take in that Starbucks cold-brew with just a little less guilt and let the fact that state surveillance laws that threaten our digital privacy are being passed during a global pandemic quietly waver past our cognitive filters. The piece is in a rapid 4/4 rhythm at 143 bpm with synth stabs and kicks happening at half-time i.e 70 bpm. Or something like that.

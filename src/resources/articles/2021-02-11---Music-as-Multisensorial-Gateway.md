The application of design principles and technology to the construction of musical spectacles is a practice with a rich global history that when properly examined has its roots in the efforts of composers and artists that were active in times well before the contemporary. And is a practice I am eager to continue. One might argue that the methods of Western Classical composition are in themselves an elaborate design system intended upon shaping noise and architectural-acoustical space for communal engagement in the observation of abstract spectacle. Many composers of the Western Canon such as Alexander Scriabin or Olivier Messian are self-reported synesthetes and commonly claim that specific sonic frequencies induce internal color perceptions. 

Similar statements are made among today’s DJs, artists, and producers so much so that a compiled Wikipedia “List of People with Synesthesia” is populated mostly by music industry professionals. 

Music originates as a multisensory experience and it is available to all that are willing to listen.

Artists in the mid-to-late 20th century began a deliberate project of externalizing and exploiting the multisensory inner flights that music engenders by employing technology to create color and visual experience to accompany deliberately composed music. Varese’s Poem Electronique being a famous example in the Western Canon -- along with a team of collaborators, Varese created a visual display to accompany a multi-speaker electronic composition in Brussels’ Philips Pavilion. The continued advance of the miniaturization of electronics and the spread of technological and informational literacy has led to the possibility of miniaturized multi-sensory spectacle. Microprocessors like the Arduino make it possible to house the gesamtkunstwerk or multisensory spectacle in structures more mobile than the stage.

It is here that the application of design thinking - which has its origins in the 1960s (a time during which the Western World is rediscovering the multisensory joys that psychotropic substances have to offer)- becomes relevant in musical orchestration and composition. Design thinking is about the iterative testing, development, and deployment of solutions to “complex, multidimensional problems,” provides the contemporary composer with a conceptual system with which to navigate and orchestrate the creation of technologically dependent spectacles that point their onlookers towards the magic of the present moment by manipulating and teasing at the ambiguity that lies at the edges of our sensory perceptions.

I’m highly motivated to continue a techno-musical praxis that asks small gatherings of people to explore what it is that they don’t know by way of technologically induced sensory overload. I believe that the application of design thinking to musical research is an appropriate path towards this goal.

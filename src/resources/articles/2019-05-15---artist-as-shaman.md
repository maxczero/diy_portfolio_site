Complex creations and artistic expressions, in human life, seem to be the byproduct of free time and a highly-active neocortex. With our basic needs regularly attended in today’s first world societies, we are left with more free time and a lack of stressful stimuli than most of our body-minds were designed to handle. Creativity today stems from a vast emptiness, a disturbing amount of peace, and uncomfortable relaxation. Evolutionary psychologists might say we are historically adapted to use creativity only when necessary as a spur of the moment reaction to adversarial conditions driven by lack of resources and absolute need - the crow fashions a twig-tool for dragging prey from the ground to satisfy an immediate hunger (Seghers, 1). 

From today’s full bellies and lives, made empty of more immediate danger, we spin webs of cerebral chaos. New symbols and expressions, the result of collaboration, and mutation of previous symbols. We fashion neocortical odysseys,  “inner-trips,” (MacFarlane,1 ), and new memes to purposefully stress and complicate our lives; produce our inner monologues and mythologies. We are addicts to novel input because it is the cybernetic catalyst, the Erisian apple, of evolutionary adaptation, maladaptation, pro-adaptation, and re-adaptation of the neocortex. The neocortex is the most recently evolved portion of the brain responsible for sensory perception, linguistic processing, and arguably the rise of technology and culture. Evolutionary psychologists concerned with the study of aesthetics locate inner-space in the neocortex.  The role of the artist then in today’s society is to be the arbiter of the random noise and chaos that drives neocortical-memetic-cybernetic-evolution; the excavator of inner-space and the collective techno-unconscious.

If you’ve ever wondered what queer-neo-soul-gospel of the cybernetic age sounds like, audiate no further. Serpenetwithfeet (Josiah Wise) is an artist that embodies this attitude of inner excavation in his artwork. With his baroque style of dress and his gospel and opera-inspired singing, his avant-pop records are holistic representations of self. He states in an NPR interview that much of his artwork is focused on finding the language to wholly express his queer life. Something he had difficulty doing in earlier life because he “lacked the language,” to do so (Martin, 3). “Four Ethers,” his most popularly streamed track on Spotify is representative of this holistic expression which he finds by bringing much of his life experience together into a unique and powerful alchemical tincture of a song.

The song opens with a sample of Hector Berlioz’s “Marche au Supplice,'' which sounds somewhat muted as though it were lifted from a vinyl recording and transferred to a digital medium. After the timpani introduces the rest of the orchestra Serpentwithfeet’s mellifluous voice begins the first verse. The orchestra and timpani begin to swell at the end of the first verse, the lyric “ocean’s overflowing,” and the rapid striking of the timpani introduce a piercing and electric high-frequency glide that is layered above the orchestra and sounds like it was composed by reversing a sample of cymbal hits. This electric layer is not present in the initial orchestral sample. 

Serpent worked in collaboration with electronic music producer The Haxan Cloak (Bobby Krlic) who is known for producing music of a dark, ambient, and droney quality. Together they fill out the rest of “Four Ethers,” by constructing a wonderful sonic interplay between layers of the analog-past and digital-present. Serpent’s operatic and loving cries to a forlorn lover dance amongst Berlioz’s opium-driven symphonic march and both are complemented by the icy use of perfectly timed vocal chorusing, artificial reverb, and other electronic effects contributed by Haxan. In this interplay of analog-past and digital-present, a type of séance occurs. Romantic sensibilities are revived in a quiet, stormy, and brutally honest exploration of darker emotions that often feels unseen in today’s zeitgeist. A zeitgeist in which only our cleanest faces are shown in public or on social media and our darkest internal musings and existential crises are saved for therapy rooms and the anonymous backchannels of the internet and fed back to us in the form of “ground-breaking,” Netflix and HBO specials (see Black Mirror). 

It’s difficult to ignore the religious language prevalent in the works of Serpentwithfeet. In “Four Ethers,” he references writing by philosopher and esotericist Rudolf Steiner in which he describes four humors or ethers of “spiritual phenomenology,” which are in part inspired by the writings of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Other works of Serpent’ will also invoke religious symbols such as his song “Cherubim,” or the lyrics “the fruit I couldn’t wait to eat,” in his song “Wrong Tree.” These religious invocations seem to inspire and heighten an atmosphere of ritual and ceremony that appropriately compliments much of his lyrical work which is aimed at recounting past experiences and removing any shame and trauma with which they might be associated. 

Serpent takes on an archetypal role of Shaman in his work. By coming to terms with his past through his artwork he sonically represents but also provides the opportunity for four marginalized voices to intersect and find relevance in a modern media where they might otherwise have little relevance in the realm of public rhetoric (rhetoric defined by dogmatically scientific and data-driven discussion). These are the voices of the queer, the black, the religiously inclined, and the Romantic. It can be difficult enough to find public representation for any one of these voices let alone the intersection of all four. But by being so holistically and honestly engaged in his artwork Serpentwithfeet provides a space of authenticity, healing, and sympathy in his music for people who share any one of these voices. One of the advantages of working as an artist in the cybernetic age is that it's easier to find a like-minded audience than it ever has been, even for voices on the fringe or avant-garde sides of artistic and human expression. 

The McLuhan Tetrad below helped generate but also summarizes much of the discussion from the text above:

Today the fastest way to find and engage with art is through the internet. Initially viewed to be a space for the free flow of information and as such the ultimate accelerator of neocortical-memetic-cybernetic-evolution, its publicly-facing sites are becoming increasingly personalized. In 2011 Eli Pariser coined the term “filter bubble,” to characterize the phenomenon by which certain search results are excluded from one’s internet queries because search algorithms on sites such as Google and Facebook are designed to provide results most relevant to your individual-historical data profile. This limits our opportunities to come into contact with conflicting information and formulate our opinions through cognitive dissonance. Given these limiting conditions, it should be the responsibility of the publicly involved artist to authentically express their being and worldview no matter how Avant, Surreal, Taboo, Absurd, and marginalized society might deem this being and worldview to be.

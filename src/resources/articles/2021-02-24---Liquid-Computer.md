I recently released an audio composition through the music streaming service Audius. A new streaming service that offers to empower audio artists by allowing them to maintain ownership of their recordings while distributing music. As artists drive up consumer engagement with Audius they earn their way to platform ownership through the $Audius cryptocurrency. Why does this matter?

Audius is one of many contemporary efforts being made to equalise earning disparities in music streaming. Amongst writers and professionals in the music industry the criticism that streaming revenues on popular apps like Spotify are rigged to favour an industry monopoly of well-established record companies and their signed artists is frequent and unavoidable. Matt Dryhurst and Holly Herndon can be heard having weekly discussions about how to better structure the music industries revenue streams in their podcast Interdependence. 

The music industry is currently structured such that independent artists struggle greatly with making a liveable income by releasing music on the internet. Prior the COVID-19 pandemic most musicians and producers earned the majority of their income through the live performance of music. The pandemic's prevention of live concerts has resulted in a necessary desire to restructure the online life of the musician such that it too can produce for them a liveable income. 

For the past few months I have been focused on exploring new aesthetic directions in my music by way of Kodwo Eshun's writing in *More Brilliant than the Sun*. His schizo-analylitic descriptions of the music production in afrofuturist sonic fictions by a myriad of hip-hop, funk and techno artists have provided for me ample inspiration in the continued development and realisation of my musical aesthetic. 

My new piece (amongst more unreleased work) is the result of engaging with some of Eshun's insightful writings.
